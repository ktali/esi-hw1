# Task 1
***implementer(s):*** Karl Kuusik

***reviewer:*** Karl Vaba

***Was the stated problem/task solved in an acceptable manner?***
<!-- (Would this count as a delivery for a potential client?) - if this is a no, 
the task is rejected and can be redone (this option can be taken four times in 
total - has to be discussed with instructors) -->

Yes, it sure was.


***What has been done well and why?***

All the required endpoints are implemented, are functional, keeping simpicity in mind.
Adding mock data is always good; makes it easy to test the endpoints (e.g with postman).

***What is not well implemented and why?***

Nothing major to complain about. Maybe it would be nice to have some response from list and random (the special feature) if there are no TODOs in the server (response other than an empty list).


***How easy is it to understand?***
<!--what is easy to understand/well documented - what is hard to understand/lacks documentation-->

It was very easy to understand. There is not much complexity in the implementation. 


***Recommendations***
<!--Are there any recommendations to simplify some of this task that the reviewer would like to share?-->

Right now, all the endpoint functionalities are in the same file, and it is fine because it's such a small project. Maintainability would probably be better if the endpoints are separated tho (not sure what GO's best practices are)


***Did the implementers use anything special that was notable for the reviewer and should eventually be shared with a bigger audience?***
<!--Note these specialties down with a positive remark to encourage sharing.-->

I am not sure what is considered notable for Go, as this is all new to me. 


***Anything notable, encouraging, or funny***

The special feature is cool. When a person is not motivated enough to go through a list of things to do, they can just get one at random and don't have to make a decision :).
