***implementer(s):*** Kaarel Loide, Karl Vaba, Kert Tali

***reviewer:*** Karl Kuusik

***Was the stated problem/task solved in an acceptable manner?***
<!-- (Would this count as a delivery for a potential client?) - if this is a no, 
the task is rejected and can be redone (this option can be taken four times in 
total - has to be discussed with instructors) -->

Most definitely!


***What has been done well and why?***

Everything required in the task has been completed. 

Backend tests were written as a shell script, which makes the most 
sense when not using a special tool for them, especially because it allows adding parameters when running the tests. 

Integration tests were written in go and are thanks to that also quite easy to run, just need to have an instance of the
backend running.


***What is not well implemented and why?***

I have no complaints, everything is well done. I am not going to cherry-pick stuff just for the sake of having 
something to put here as an answer.


***How easy is it to understand?***
<!--what is easy to understand/well documented - what is hard to understand/lacks documentation-->

Everything is quite easy to run, usually done by just 2-3 commands.


***Recommendations***
<!--Are there any recommendations to simplify some of this task that the reviewer would like to share?-->

I have nothing to recommend since everything is quite efficient already.


***Did the implementers use anything special that was notable for the reviewer and should eventually be shared with a bigger audience?***
<!--Note these specialties down with a positive remark to encourage sharing.-->

The usage of a shell script for functional tests is quite remarkable and respectable in my opinion.


***Anything notable, encouraging, or funny***

Nothing special to report.
